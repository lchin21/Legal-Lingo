## How to use with Parcel and TypeScript

To use this Chrome Extension with Parcel and TypeScript, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Update your `package.json` file with the following scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "parcel src/index.html",
  "build": "parcel build src/index.html"
}
```

3. Run the development server with `npm start` and build the extension with `npm run build`.

Now you should be able to use Parcel and TypeScript to develop and build your Chrome Extension.
